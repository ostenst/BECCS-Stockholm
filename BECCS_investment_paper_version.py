## ROBUST DECISION MAKING (RDM) MODEL FOR BECCS
# Author: Oscar StenstrÃ¶m
# Date: 2023-02-16

# This program was developed to perform a Robust Decision Making (RDM) analysis of the investment 
# decision of deploying a bioenergy carbon capture and storage deployment (BECCS) facility. The 
# case studied is the planned BECCS facility of Stockholm Exergi (more info at www.beccs.se).
# The program utilizes Rhodium, an open-source Python library for RDM and exploratory modeling: 
# https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium
# To run the program, first follow the installation guide provided in the repository. Make sure 
# this file "BECCS_investment_paper_version.py" is in the root "Rhodium" folder.

## GLOSSARY
# NE       = negative emission, i.e. one tonne of atmospheric CO2 permanently removed and stored 
# CF       = cash flow
# p        = price
# dt       = "likely" change over time (high value => higher probability of the parameter increasing
#                                        low value => higher probability of the parameter decreasing)
# y        = year
# AUCTION  = a percentage of specific BECCS costs covered by a reversed auctions policy 
# yQUOTA   = a year when quota obligations of NEs could be imposed
# yEUint   = a year when NEs could be integrated in an EU scheme for carbon removal trading
# yBIOban  = a year when the usage of biomass as renewable energy could be severely restricted
# yCLAIM   = a year when the claiming and selling of NEs to the voluntary carbon market is allowed
# SOW      = state of the world, i.e. one specific combination of conditions (parameter values)
# -Invest- = when emphasized, Invest refers to the decision to invest in the BECCS facility
# -Wait-   = when emphasized, Wait refers to the decision to not invest in the BECCS facility

## CONSTRUCT THE CALCULATION MODEL 
# The calculations below aim to quantify the annual prices of electricity, heat and NEs (i.e. the 
# revenues), as well as the different costs of the Invest and Wait strategies. This is done for 27 
# time slots, as the model runs from 2024 (year 0) to 2050 (year 26). These values are then used to
# calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of both strategies, and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) (only 
# real solutions) of the Invest strategy. 

# One can set investment_decision = 1 if Invest is of interest, or investment_decision = 0 if Wait 
# is of interest. 

# One can set pelectricity_dt = [-1,0.4] depending on if trends of lower or higher electricity 
# prices are explored, or pheat_dt = [-0.5,0.7] depending on if trends of lower or higher heat 
# prices are explored.
