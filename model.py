"""ROBUST DECISION MAKING (RDM) MODEL FOR BECCS

This program was developed to perform a Robust Decision Making (RDM) analysis of the investment
decision of deploying a bioenergy carbon capture and storage deployment (BECCS) facility. The 
program utilizes Rhodium, an open-source Python library for RDM and exploratory modeling:
https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium
To run the program, first follow the installation guide provided in the repository. Make sure
the file "controller.py" is in the root "Rhodium" folder before running it in the terminal.

Glossary
--------
NE       = negative emission, i.e. one tonne of atmospheric CO2 permanently removed and stored
CF       = cash flow
p        = price
dt       = price variability (as a percentage of the price)
y        = year
VCM      = voluntary carbon market
AUCTION  = a percentage of specific BECCS costs covered by a reversed auctions policy
yQUOTA   = a year when quota obligations of NEs could be imposed
yEUint   = a year when NEs could be integrated in an EU scheme for carbon removal trading
yBIOban  = a year when the usage of biomass as renewable energy could be severely restricted
yCLAIM   = a year when the claiming and selling of NEs to the voluntary carbon market is allowed
ySHOCK   = a year when energy prices see a shock increase
SOW      = state of the world, i.e. one specific combination of conditions (parameter values)
-Invest- = when emphasized, Invest refers to the decision to invest in the BECCS facility
-Wait-   = when emphasized, Wait refers to the decision to never invest in the BECCS facility

NOTE: See the main article and its supplementary materials for detailed descriptions of the 
methods and equations used.

## CONSTRUCT THE CALCULATION MODEL
# The calculations below aim to quantify the annual prices of electricity, heat and NEs (i.e. the
# revenues), as well as the different costs of the Invest and Wait strategies. This is done for 27
# time slots, as the model runs from 2024 (year 0) to 2050 (year 26). These values are then used to
# calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of both strategies.

# One can set investment_decision = 1 if Invest is of interest, or investment_decision = 0 if Wait
# is of interest.
