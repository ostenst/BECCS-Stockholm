# Questions from Will
- Is there any statistical relationship (e.g. correlation) between heat, electricity and emissions prices? To what extent are/not these represented in the prices?
- Why is price of biomass held constant?
- What justification for the synthetic price functions?
- Why set trajectories for `pelectricity_dt` and `pheat_dt` instead of including them in the uncertainties and using them as a means for exploring the scenario space?
