"""ROBUST DECISION MAKING (RDM) MODEL FOR BECCS

This program was developed to perform a Robust Decision Making (RDM) analysis of the investment
decision of deploying a bioenergy carbon capture and storage deployment (BECCS) facility. The
case studied is the planned BECCS facility of Stockholm Exergi (more info at www.beccs.se).
The program utilizes Rhodium, an open-source Python library for RDM and exploratory modeling:
https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium
To run the program, first follow the installation guide provided in the repository. Make sure
this file "BECCS_investment_paper_version.py" is in the root "Rhodium" folder.
